#  Mini Project 3 â€“ Black-Scholes Option Sensitivities

Small visual study of how European call and put prices, plus their Greeks (Theta, Delta), change with **time to expiration** and **spot price**.

## Key Points
- **Price vs Time:** Call price falls and is concave; Theta is always negative and blows up near expiry.
- **Price vs Spot:** Call price is convex; Delta goes from 0 to 1. Put price mirrors this behaviour.
- **Greeks:** Visuals confirm textbook Greeks and help intuition.
